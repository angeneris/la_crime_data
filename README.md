Triple Ten DS Sprint 4 Project: LA Crime Data from 2020 to 2024

For this project, I obtained data from the crimes based in Los Angeles, CA. Using a csv file containing a large data set of crimes between the years 2020 - early 2024, I have compiled a few key points that illustrate the themes found in the data.

This is a very large data set, containing almost 100k rows of data, spanning the last 4 years.
The full dataframe has been uploaded to this repository using git-lfs. 
A sample of 50,000 was used for analysis purpose of this data.
