**Description:** The Los Angeles Crime Data Analysis project is a Python application built using Streamlit for the web interface. It aims to provide insights into crime patterns and trends in Los Angeles County by analyzing a dataset comprising reported crimes between 2020 and the present. The analysis includes visualization of overall crime trends, top crime categories, yearly crime trends by neighborhood, and more.

The project utilizes libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly Express for data manipulation and visualization. The Streamlit framework is used to create an interactive web application that allows users to explore the crime data and visualize trends through interactive charts and graphs.
