LA Crime Data from 2020 to 2024

Triple Ten Sprint 4 Project

For this project, I obtained data from the crimes based in Los Angeles, CA. Using a csv file containing a large data set of crimes between the years 2020 - early 2024, I have compiled a few key points that illustrate the themes found in the data.

This is a very large data set, containing almost 100k rows of data, spanning the last 4 years.
